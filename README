Semi-functional python implementation of a range and range rate extended kalman filter for initial orbit determination.

From James: A note about development - when I originally began working on the code for this project, I began by implementing the rough code as I had then drafted it in MATLAB. This is because Visual Studio Code and matplotlib do not properly work together on my machine and interactive plots do not function (with all plots instead needing to be saved locally). As such, proto.m made to allow me to zoom in on potentiall suspect plots and more easily diagnose issues with implementation before writing the bulk of the program in python.
